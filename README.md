# changecolor
Build, using HTML, CSS and pure JavaScript, an application for visualizing colors from the RGB scale.
Exercise the following concepts worked on in the Module:

Use of HTML elements.
Use of CSS.
Use of identifiers in HTML elements.
Capture reference elements with JavaScript.
JavaScript event handling.
Use of functions with JavaScript and CSS.
Direct CSS manipulation with JavaScript.

Implement, through HTML, CSS and pure JavaScript, an application that contains three inputs of the “range” type, whose values ​​range from 0 to 255 and represent, respectively, R (Red - Red), G (Green - Green) and B (Blue - Blue).
This combination of values ​​must be used to fill the background color of a square <div>.
In addition, include three read-only (disabled) text inputs for viewing the current value of each range-type input.
As the user changes the value of the ranges with the ← and → keys on the keyboard, the <div> should reflect the corresponding color.
